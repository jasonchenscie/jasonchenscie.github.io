        <p>This was one of the projects I did for my internship at Solutions Resource, a software consulting company locating in Seattle. As one of the two UX/UI designers at the company, I was in charge of the whole process of user experience design. I led and conducted <strong>user research</strong> and <strong>usability testing</strong>, created <strong>low and high fidelity mockups, </strong>and presented <strong>design report</strong>.</p>

          <p>We started the project by identifying its scope. Since Solutions Resource was a startup and thus things were not as organized, we decided to split the scoping process into two - interview + questionnaire. We first interviewed the CEO to learn about the company goals in general. Then, we brainstormed based on the interview as a team and generated a questionnaire inquiring details of the objectives and goals of the website and the company, for example, “what are the main services of the company you want to highlight?” This way, the CEO had the chance to think in detailed about the goals and we both would be on the same page regarding the objectives because of the shared written document.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>After analyzing the scoping process, we learned that the objectives and goals of the website were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Geared towards small-mid size company</li>
            <li>Introduced new programs of the company</li>
            <li>Highlighted past projects that were more authoritative (names not disclosed here)</li>
            <li>Communicated clearly the relationship between the Philippine office and Seattle office (currently people think they were outsourcing from Philippine, but they were not!)</li>

          <p>As a team, we converted the objectives and goals into heuristics for the website, for example, “Does the landing page highlight the new programs of the company?“ We then carried out <strong>heuristic evaluation</strong> on the website to see to what extent did the website communicate company&#x27;s goals. We also see if there were any usability problems on the design, content and usability of the website, according to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen Norman Group heuristics</a>.</p>

            <li><strong>Clarity</strong> - The website should clearly communicate the company&#x27;s services to potential clients</li>
            <li><strong>Selling</strong> - The website should sell the company to potential clients and makes them want to hire Solutions Resource</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - The website should align with the company&#x27;s brand and targeted clients (small/mid size companies)</li>

          <p>Using the objectives generated above, we conducted research to gather more data on the problems on the website. The goals were to understand how participant understand the page content and navigate within the page. This could help quickly determine what further research methods were needed, if applicable.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h5>Method: Remote Usability Testing with Past Clients</h5>
          <p>Due to the tight time frame, we decided that a quick usability test with past clients would be the fastest way to generate the most insights. Past clients were Solutions Resource&#x27;s target audience and they were not recruited from the website, thus they must have appropriate insights to offer. Since our past clients were all busy, a remote usability test was the most fitting.</p>
          <h5>Details: Participants &amp; Protocol</h5>
          <p>We sent emails to selected past clients. 2 males &amp; 1 female were recruited. To accommodate participants&#x27; location and time, we used <strong>Google Hangout.</strong> We utilized the &quot;<strong>share screen</strong>&quot; feature to get a rough idea where the participants were looking at. We used <strong>think aloud</strong> protocol to keep track of participants&#x27; thought. If participants fell silent during the test, we would kindly remind them by asking &quot;what are you thinking now?&quot; Below was a <strong>rough guideline</strong> we generate for the usability test, based on what the participants said, <strong>ad hoc questions</strong> might be asked. The Google hangout sessions were recorded for later analysis purpose.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Take 30s to look at the page, then briefly describe to us what this page is about</li>
            <li>How do you feel when you see this page?</li>
            <li>On a scale from 1-5 (1 being not convincing. 5 being very convincing), how convincing are you to hire Solutions Resources to build your product? If not, why?</li>
            <li>What do you think this specific item is describing? </li>
          </ol>

          <h5>Analyzing The Usability Test: Method</h5>
          <p>Using the recorded Google Hangout sessions, we analyzed the usability tests using affinity diagramming. Noticeable behaviors and words said by participants were written on a post-it note, and grouped to the emerging themes, so we problems of the website could be identified from a user&#x27;s perspectives.</p>

          <h5>Insights: What We Learned</h5>
          <blockquote><em><strong>&quot;I&#x27;m not entirely sure what your company does from the website&quot;</strong></em></blockquote>
          <p>Participants reported that they lost interest because they did not seem to know what Solutions Resource did by looking at the landing page. The introduction of the services provided by the company was hidden in a secondary menu bar. The only relevant information was the coding language and platform slide bar; however, this did not fully capture other programs and services Solutions Resource provided, e.g. startup acceleration.</p>
          <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/3342e1_38ea7f8b2ee2499698ee0373abdab756-mv2.png"></div>
            <figcaption>Important items were too buried</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>‍</p>
          <blockquote><strong><em>&quot;I&#x27;m not convinced to hire Solutions Resource based on the website&quot;</em></strong></blockquote>
          <p>The subpage content did not convince users to hire Solutions Resource to work for them because it lacked vital decision-making information such as affordability. Moreover, participants reported that they sometimes could not understand the subpage content because it was full of technical jargon.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <blockquote><strong>&quot;</strong><em><strong>wait..it doesn&#x27;t work when I click it...it&#x27;s not clickable?</strong></em><strong>&quot;</strong></blockquote>
          <p>Design elements such as color, positioning of graphics, etc. were reported being confusing by participants. For example, The side-way positioning of the graphic below made participants think it was a slide bar. This led to confusion and frustration because participants tried to interact with that graphic. The large variety of colors used on several pages were also reported as confusing by participants.</p>

          <h5>Goals:</h5>
          <p>Based on the findings, we identified our redesigned website must -</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Clearly show Solutions Resource&#x27;s service on homepage</li>
            <li>Content must sell Solutions Resource to the users</li>
            <li>the amount of design elements (e.g. color) should decrease</li>
          </ol>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h5>Ideation:</h5>
          <p>From the goals we defined above, we started to sketch out the wireframe for the landing page. Below are two examples of the sketches generated by my team member and I.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><strong>Solution Sketch 1: Display key services and &quot;about us&quot; at the top</strong></p>
          <figure class="w-richtext-align-normal w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/3342e1_992443300e884bbaba2d2e8b0153bb5e-mv2_d_2448_3264_s_4_2.jpg"></div>
            <figcaption>sketch example 1</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons:</strong></p>
          <p>This solution was good because it showed important information of the company at a very obvious location on the landing page; however, this is hard to do because of the wide range of services Solutions Resource provided. This would also make the page to be rather long - users could get bored in scrolling.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><strong>Solution sketch 2 - Let users find out the services according to the interest &amp; display selective key programs</strong> </p>
          <figure class="w-richtext-align-normal w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/3342e1_bd4aeaf07dc447a5a3e4a4ac4217b767-mv2_d_2448_3264_s_4_2.jpg"></div>
            <figcaption>sketch example 2</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons:</strong></p>
          <p>This solution let the user discover the wide range of services Solutions Resource provided by letting them interact with an &quot;information query&quot; section. This was good because it solved the problem of low discover-ability of the programs, and avoid displaying them all at once. It also allowed key programs to be highlighted. However, the layout of the key program and &quot;information query&quot; section were not immediately clear.  </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h5>Wireframe:</h5>
          <p>We came back together and discussed on each of our sketches, based on design and the ability to address the problems, we decided to merge the above two sketch into one. We then created a digital wireframe and showed it to the CEO. The wireframe is shown as below -</p>
          <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/3342e1_3fa450e5fb2045a5997d98379b0b7191-mv2.jpg"></div>
            <figcaption>wireframe for the homepage redesign</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>Three sections worth noting here - </p>
          <p>​<strong>#2</strong>: <strong>An information query section</strong>, it would allow users to choose what their interests were, and displayed information accordingly. This way users could discover Solutions Resource&#x27;s service by their interests.</p>
          <p><strong>#3</strong>: A <strong>combination</strong> of &quot;<strong>about us</strong>&quot; and <strong>brief description</strong> of what Solutions Resource did. This way users could get a quick idea of what Solutions Resource was.</p>
          <p><strong>#4</strong>: <strong>Key</strong> <strong>programs highlight</strong>. This way all the key programs got to be highlighted and users might not necessarily know that they were interested in them until seeing them. </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h5>Hi-fi Mockup:</h5>
          <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By6KKzZYlQvLdXl1LVZ1ZjY1djQ" class="w-inline-block">

            </a>
            <figcaption>hi-fi mockup (click to view full image)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>With the approval of the CEO, we then proceeded to create the high-fi mockup of the landing page. Some noteworthy sections are described followed: </p>
          <p>​<strong>1. The information query section</strong></p>
          <p>This was built around a question &quot;what do you want to build today?&quot;. The question not only implied that Solutions Resource &quot;build&quot; things (such as applications), but it also engaged with users by allowing them to interact with it. The users could then choose an option from the drop-down list (which was a list briefly categorizing Solutions Resource&#x27;s services), and relevant links would display on the right. This way the users would not need to dig in the menu to discover different services.</p>
          <p>​<strong>2. Landing page complied with the brand color</strong></p>
          <p>To make the landing page cleaner and less visually busy, we took out all the irrelevant color and build the webpage using the brand color (blue) and other matching colors. </p>
          <p>​<strong>3. Key programs arranged vertically with short descriptions</strong></p>
          <p>To effectively display the key programs, we decided that we must include a short description with each program, so that users could get an idea what that program was and decided if they wanted to learn more.</p>
          <h5>‍</h5>
          <h5>Subpage Content Template:</h5>
          <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/3342e1_25b262b5b1754e048cfe0a023c52cd72-mv2.png"></div>
            <figcaption>subpage content template</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>After designing the hi-fi mockup, we then decided to address the problem of the subpage content. Although the CEO only required us to finish the visual mockup, we took the initiatives to communicate the full finding of the usability testing to the company. Since the content was written by the marketing team, we decided that it would be the most effective for us to generate a &quot;content template&quot; using the findings from the usability test. We first organized the findings related to the content in a list. Then, we put it on the wireframe we created earlier, and used different colors to indicate different content type.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h5>Design Report:</h5>
          <p>Finally, we curated all of our findings and recommendations into a formal <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By6KKzZYlQvLM0tWMXZheWlRSUk/view?usp=sharing">design recommendation document</a> and presented it to the CEO. The CEO was very satisfied with the outcome and handed the document to development team for development.</p>
